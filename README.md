# BitwiseOperators-EXP4-

This program illustrates the use of bitwise operators in C++, which operate directly on the binary representation of integers. Bitwise operations are low-level operations that are often used in systems programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.

The following bitwise operations are demonstrated:

1. Bitwise AND (&)
Operation: Compares each bit of a and b. If both bits are 1, the result is 1; otherwise, it is 0.

2. Bitwise OR (|)
Operation: Compares each bit of a and b. If either bit is 1, the result is 1.

3. Bitwise NOT (~)
Operation: Flips all the bits of the operand. Converts all 0s to 1s and vice versa.

5. Bitwise XOR (^)
Operation: Compares each bit of a and b. If the bits are different, the result is 1; otherwise, it is 0.

6. Left Shift (<<)
Operation: Shifts all bits of a to the left by n positions, inserting 0s from the right. This is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2ⁿ.

8. Right Shift (>>) 
Operation: Shifts all bits of a to the right by n positions, discarding bits on the right. This is equivalent to integer division by 2ⁿ

Conclusion:
This program effectively demonstrates how various bitwise operations work in C++. Bitwise operators are powerful tools for low-level data manipulation, offering optimized performance in situations where direct binary manipulation is required.
